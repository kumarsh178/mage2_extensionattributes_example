Extension attributes are Magento 2's approach to providing stability as well as customizablity.

The are basically containers for additional data that we want to add to our entities.

Every interface extends \Magento\Framework\Api\ExtensibleDataInterface can be extended by extension attributes.

The methods defined in ExtensibleDataInterface provide access to the objects that contain additional data.


The interface \Magento\Sales\Api\Data\OrderExtensionInterface is generated by Magento, either on the fly in development
mode, or as part of the compilation process. 

The code generation happens via \Magento\Framework\Code\Generator for any
interface which can't be loaded. It will read our xml configuration and create an interface which includes a getter and setter
for our fooman_attribute.

The example of using extension_attribute, please look at vendor/magento/module-gift-message module.
